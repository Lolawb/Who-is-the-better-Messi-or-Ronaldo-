  <p>Let's look at Lionel Messi first. To inroduce him, he is a 36 year old man from Argentina, who plays football professionally and is one of the greatest players of all time. Messi started out playing as a left winger/CAM  for Barcelona in 2004. In his early days, he then switched to right winger and now plays as a forward for Inter Miami CF and his country (Argentina), who wears the number 10. </p><p>During in games, Lionel Messi also has a very strange tactic. If you watch him play in a game, you may notice that he isn't running as much as you would expect. Messi himself hasn't commented on his strategy of walking, but one of his former coaches has given an explanation. "He's not running, but he is always watching what happens," Pep Guardiola, Messi's former Barcelona coach, said in the "This Is Football" documentary, per The Athletic.  </p><p>Most Ballon d'Or awards:7 <img align="right"src="https://sky.shorthandstories.com/messi-perfect-ending/assets/ckU1G7EE5Y/ap22352771589324-3677x2451.jpg" style="height:300px;width:450px;"/>
